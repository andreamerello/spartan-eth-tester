Spartan 3AN demo board sample Ethernet TX
=========================================

This is an experiment with my Spartan 3AN demo board.
**WARNING**: I'm a software developer, not an ASIC designer. This is something I play with, and most likely this is a **BAD** design example.

This is a ethernet frame generator, that should be able to send intentionally malformed ethernet frames for testing purposes (for example testing linux ethernet drivers about this specific situation).

For now it is *only* able to send a intentionally broken frame by pressing the board "UP" button.
